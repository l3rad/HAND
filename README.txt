Things I need to fix:

Make sure only 1 button can be present! Everything that makes one visible must ALWAYS make another not visible

Work on save logic. If the deck already exists, don't save it but clear the currentDeck and display message saying it's a duplicate deck
If the deck doesn't already exist and it has 9 cards, save it and clear the currentDeck
if the deck has less than 9 cards, don't clear the currentDeck or save, but close the drawer
